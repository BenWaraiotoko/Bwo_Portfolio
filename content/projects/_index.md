## My Data Engineering Projects

Here are the hands-on projects I develop as part of my training and self-learning journey. Each project is hosted on GitHub with source code and documentation.

These projects demonstrate my skills in **Python**, **SQL**, **ETL**, and **data orchestration**. They evolve as I continue learning.
