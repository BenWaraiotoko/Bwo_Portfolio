## Stuff I've Built

Projects I'm working on. Most are practical solutions to problems I've actually encountered.

<div class="intro-block">

**Not polished portfolio pieces** — Real projects built while learning. Some work great, some are works in progress. All have messy commit histories.

Code and documentation on GitHub. Expect rough edges.
