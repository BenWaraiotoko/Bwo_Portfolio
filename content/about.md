## Hello, I'm Benjamin 👋 – Data Engineer in progress 🚀

![Profile Picture](/images/Portrait_Ben.png)

**10+ years in video production & broadcast infrastructure. Now diving into data pipelines.**
## Background
I spent a decade working on extreme sports documentaries, TV production, and broadcast systems—managing everything from live encoding pipelines to complex infrastructure. **That's actually perfect training for data engineering.** Automating video workflows taught me to think in ETL. Managing distributed systems taught me about reliability at scale.

I currently work as a broadcast infrastructure technician near Monaco, managing VMware/vSphere infrastructure for linear television broadcasting.
Now I'm formalizing those instincts with Python, SQL, and real data projects.

## Why data?

It's the natural next step. The problems are similar—**move data reliably, automate workflows, solve for scale**—but the sandbox is bigger and the tools are more interesting.

I like learning. I like building things. This is both.

---

## What's my plan'

**Learning** — Codecademy Data Path (Python, SQL, analytics fundamentals)  
**Bootcamp** — Le Wagon (autumn 2026) for intensive hands-on training  
**Building** — ETL projects, data analysis, automation scripts  
**Networking** — Connecting with data professionals to learn from their experiences

---

## Tech Stack

### Actively Learning (Codecademy Data Engineer Path)
- **Python** — Fundamentals, Intermediate, Advanced Python; Pandas for data manipulation
- **SQL** — Fundamentals & Advanced SQL for data engineering
- **Big Data** — PySpark for distributed data processing
- **NoSQL** — MongoDB (CRUD operations, document databases)
- **Version Control** — Git workflows, command line, deployment
- **Data Engineering** — Data wrangling, cleaning, tidying; ETL pipelines

### Current Expertise
- **Infrastructure** — VMware, Docker, Linux, networking
- **Broadcast** — Broadcast infrastructure, FFmpeg, live systems—still useful for understanding data flows under pressure.

## What I value

- **Systems thinking** — How pieces fit together matters more than individual tools
- **Automation** — Manual work is a sign you haven't automated enough
- **Learning by doing** — Theory is fine, but projects teach faster
- **Reliability** — Broadcast taught me that "it usually works" isn't acceptable
