## Hey, I'm Ben 👋

![Profile Picture](/images/Portrait_Ben.png)

**Broadcast infrastructure technician in Monaco. Learning data engineering to level up my technical game.**

## What I Do

I am working on infrastructure for linear television broadcasting. Before that, spent 10+ years doing extreme sports documentaries, TV production, and supervising post production.

Turns out, managing live encoding pipelines and distributed broadcast infrastructure is basically ETL work in disguise. Who knew? 🤷‍♂️

## Why I'm Learning This Stuff

Broadcast infrastructure already involves:

- Moving data reliably (video streams, metadata, logs)
- Automating workflows (transcoding, archiving, monitoring)
- Solving for scale (live TV doesn't buffer)

So I'm formalizing those instincts with Python, SQL, and proper data engineering practices. Same problems, better tools, more automation possibilities.

Plus, it's fun to actually understand what's happening under the hood instead of just keeping systems running.

## The Plan

**Learning:** Codecademy Data Engineer path (Python, SQL, pandas, PySpark)
**Building:** ETL projects, automation scripts, anything that makes work easier
**Future:** Le Wagon bootcamp (2026) for intensive hands-on training

## Tech Stack

**Currently learning:**

- Python (fundamentals → pandas → automation)
- SQL (queries, optimization, data modeling)
- Git (finally learning proper version control)
- Data pipelines (cleaning, wrangling, ETL)

**Already know:**

- VMware/vSphere infrastructure
- Docker, Linux, networking
- Broadcast systems
- Keeping live systems running when things break at 3am

## What Matters to Me

- **Systems thinking:** How pieces fit together > individual tools
- **Automation:** If you do it twice, automate it
- **Learning by doing:** Projects > tutorials
- **Reliability:** "It usually works" isn't good enough
