## What I Did This Month

**Codecademy Progress:** 0% → 16%
**Learning Hours:** ~20 hours

### Completed
- ✅ Intro to Data Engineering
- ✅ Python Fundamentals (80% done)
- ✅ Built this portfolio site (Hugo + Cloudflare Pages)

### What I Learned
- Python basics: variables, functions, data types
- Git version control
- Hugo static site generation

### Fun Problems I Solved
- **Hugo CSS debugging:** Spent 3 hours fighting with theme overrides before reading the docs properly 😅 I learn Python not css 
- **Time management:** Tried to do too much at once, now sticking to 2-hour evening sessions instead of weekend marathons

### Cool Thing I Found
Codecademy's IDE is annoying, so I just do all exercises in VS Code instead. Much better.

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) - Solid start!
