## 🚧 Blockers & Solutions

### Blocker 1: Hugo Theme Customization

**Issue:** Struggled with Hugo template syntax and theme override mechanisms

**Impact:** Spent 3 hours debugging CSS and layout issues

**Solution:**
- ✅ Resolved by thoroughly reading Hugo documentation
- ✅ Created custom CSS in assets/ directory following Hugo conventions
- ✅ Learned about Hugo pipes and resource processing

**Lesson Learned:** Invest time upfront in understanding framework conventions rather than trial-and-error approach. Documentation is essential.

### Blocker 2: Time Management

**Issue:** Balancing learning time with other commitments

**Impact:** Felt overwhelmed trying to cover too much too quickly

**Solution:**
- 🚧 Created structured weekly schedule with dedicated learning blocks
- 🚧 Prioritizing Codecademy modules on weekday evenings (2 hours)
- 🚧 Portfolio/project work on weekends (4-6 hours)
- 🚧 Setting realistic weekly goals rather than overcommitting

**Lesson Learned:** Consistent, focused study sessions are more effective than marathon learning sessions. Quality over quantity.

## 🔄 Reflection

### What Went Well

- Successfully launched professional development portfolio
- Made solid progress on Codecademy (15% in Week 0 and 1)
- Development environment fully configured and ready
- Created structured learning schedule and workflow

### What Could Be Improved

- Need more hands-on coding practice beyond tutorials
- Should document learnings while concepts are fresh
- Balance between learning and building needs refinement
- Time allocation could be more efficient
- Don't really appreciate the codecademy coding module, so I do the exercises on Visual Studio Code instead

### Professional Growth

This week marked the beginning of a structured approach to expanding data engineering skills. The fundamentals learned (Python, Git) are directly applicable to optimizing broadcast infrastructure workflows. Looking forward to applying these concepts to real-world media technology challenges in upcoming projects.

**Key Insight:** Data engineering skills complement broadcast infrastructure expertise, opening opportunities for workflow automation, infrastructure monitoring optimization, and data-driven decision making in media operations.
