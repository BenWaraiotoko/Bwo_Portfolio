# Python Fundamentals: Complete Learning Roadmap

26 hours of Python, organized so you don't have to guess what to study next. This page maps **11 comprehensive guides** into a structured learning path — from basic loops to production ETL patterns. Work through it in sequence and you'll arrive at Le Wagon bootcamp (October 2026) ahead of the curve, not scrambling to keep up.

## 📍 Quick Navigation

**Start here based on your level:**

- **🟢 Beginner (haven't coded much):** Start with **TIER 1**
- **🟡 Intermediate (coded before):** Start with **TIER 2**
- **🔴 Advanced (need just the gaps):** Jump to **TIER 3**

## 🗓️ Le Wagon Timeline Alignment

### Before Bootcamp Starts (Oct 31, 2026)

| Milestone | Date | What to Know | Pages |
|-----------|------|--------------|-------|
| **Complete TIER 1** | By Aug 31 | Functions, loops, lists | 1-6 |

**Reference:** [[Python-for-Data-Engineering]]

**Weeks 3-4:**  
Learn Airflow orchestration (builds on classes/OOP)  
**Reference:** [[Python-Classes-and-OOP]]

**Weeks 5+:**  
PySpark, distributed processing, production patterns

## 📝 Study Strategy

### Daily Workflow (60 min/day)

```
Week 1-4 (TIER 1):
├─ 40 min: Read + code examples from page
├─ 15 min: Complete mini-project (if provided)
└─ 5 min: Update your own notes

Week 5-8 (TIER 2):
├─ 30 min: Read advanced concepts
├─ 20 min: Apply to your own code
└─ 10 min: Refactor old projects with new knowledge

Week 9-12 (TIER 3):
├─ 30 min: Read data engineering patterns
├─ 25 min: Build small ETL project
└─ 5 min: Document learnings
```

### How to Use This Roadmap

1. **Start with TIER 1, Page 1** → Read until you understand the concept
2. **Code along** → Copy examples, modify them, break them intentionally
3. **Mini-project** → If page has one, complete it (weather ETL, etc.)
4. **Link references** → Click `[[Related]]` links when you need context
5. **Consolidate** → Review one page per week once you've finished TIER 1

## 🎓 Before You Start: Prerequisites Check

You should be able to answer "yes" to all:

- [ ] Can you write `x = 5; print(x)` and understand what happens?
- [ ] Do you know what `if`, `for`, `while` keywords do (roughly)?
- [ ] Can you explain what a function is (takes input, returns output)?
- [ ] Are you comfortable with the command line (running `python script.py`)?

**If any are "no":** Spend 2 hours on Codecademy Python basics first, then come back here.

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls (Don't Fall Into These!)

| Pitfall | Why It Matters | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| Skipping TIER 1 basics | You'll get confused later | Discipline yourself to master loops/functions first |
| Not coding the examples | Reading ≠ learning programming | Type every code block, modify it, break it |
| Ignoring type hints | Production code breaks silently | Type hints catch bugs early (mypy helps) |
| Not understanding errors | You'll waste hours debugging | Read error messages carefully; they tell you what's wrong |
| Forgetting try/except | Scripts crash in production | Error handling is not optional (see TIER 2) |

---

## ✅ Consolidation Checklist

After completing each TIER, verify your knowledge:

### After TIER 1
- [ ] Write a function that loops through a list and returns transformed results
- [ ] Use list comprehensions instead of loops
- [ ] Explain when to use a `while` loop vs. a `for` loop
- [ ] Create a dict, access keys, iterate items
- [ ] Use `if/elif/else` with `and`/`or` operators

### After TIER 2
- [ ] Add type hints to your functions (int, str, list[dict])
- [ ] Parse a CSV line into a dict using `.split()` and `.strip()`
- [ ] Wrap code in try/except and handle specific exceptions
- [ ] Write a custom exception class
- [ ] Use f-strings with formatting (e.g., `f"{value:.2f}"`)

### After TIER 3
- [ ] Design a class with `__init__` and methods
- [ ] Create a simple pandas DataFrame from a list of dicts
- [ ] Write a complete ETL function: extract → transform → load
- [ ] Add logging to your pipeline
- [ ] Explain when to use pandas vs. PySpark
