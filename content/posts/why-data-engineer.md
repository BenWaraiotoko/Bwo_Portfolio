## The Turning Point

After more than 15 years in video production, postproduction and now broadcast infrastructure, I want a new challenge and I want to learn new technologies.

<div class="intro-block">

My passion for **automation** and **Python scripting** naturally led me toward Data Engineering — a field that combines infrastructure, code, and data.

</div>

## What Attracts Me to Data Engineering

### 1. Solving Real-World Problems

Building data pipelines is about solving complex puzzles: how to extract efficiently? How to transform cleanly? How to ensure quality?

### 2. Large-Scale Automation

My infrastructure experience gives me a solid foundation for understanding distributed systems, orchestration, and monitoring — crucial skills in Data Engineering.

### 3. A Growing Market

Global data volumes are exploding. Companies need professionals capable of structuring, cleaning, and making this data actionable.


## The Challenges

I won't lie: learning Python and SQL while working my current job requires discipline. But each small step forward brings me closer to my goal.

## Conclusion

Career transition is a marathon, not a sprint. This blog will document my journey, projects, and learnings. If you're in a similar situation, don't hesitate to reach out — we go further together.
